# CountryCard

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.2.

## Why use SSR?

We have a large dataset to load, so using SSR (Server-Side Rendering) helps improve the performance of the application by reducing the time to first meaningful paint and handling large amounts of data more efficiently.

## Why use Angular Material?

I wanted to gain hands-on experience with Angular Material, and this project provided an opportunity to implement it.

## Why use `data.ts` instead of a JSON file?

By using `data.ts`, I can ensure that data is validated and typed correctly at compile time, reducing the risk of runtime errors due to incorrect or malformed data.

## Why is the UI not more polished?

The primary focus of this project is performance and functionality, not UI/UX design. However, I still aimed to make the UI reasonably user-friendly.

## Why not use a Backend?

The project specifications did not require a backend, so I opted for a simple `data.ts` file to store and serve data, minimizing complexity.

## Why not clean the Data?

Given the sheer volume of data, manually cleaning it would have been time-consuming. For the sake of focusing on other key areas, I chose to work with the data as-is.
